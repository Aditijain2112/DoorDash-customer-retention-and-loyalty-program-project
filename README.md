# Customer Retention and loyalty program project

Objective of the Program: 
The primary goal of the "Dash Rewards" loyalty program is to enhance customer retention, increase repeat order frequency, and reduce churn by providing tailored incentives and rewards. This initiative focuses on driving customer engagement through a structured tier-based system that encourages higher spending and frequent use of the platform. By rewarding customers for their continued patronage, the program aims to boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and foster brand loyalty.
